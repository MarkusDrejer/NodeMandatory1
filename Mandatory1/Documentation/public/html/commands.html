        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <div class="examples" id="cdC">
                    <h2>cd</h2>
                    <p>Stands for 'change directory' and as the name describes it is used to change the current directory.</p>
                    <h3>cd &lt;path&gt;</h3>
                        <p>To navigate through your directories use cd with the path of your destination.
                            <br>The path is not case sensitive.</p>
                    <h3>cd ..</h3>
                        <p>When you have gone in too far or need to move back up a directory use cd ..</p>
                    <h3>cd/</h3>
                        <p>Only using / with cd will move you all the way up to the root directory.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="nodeC">
                    <h2>node</h2>
                        <p>The node command will try to load module located in the folder you pass, and start whatever is written in "main" section of package.json.</p>
                    <h3>node &lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>In order to run a node application you prefix with node followed by the path to the file you wish to run, lastly write the filename plus its extension.</p>
                    <h3>node &lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>If your terminal is already on the desired path of the file to be run, the path can be omitted from the command and the filename can be directly used.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="npmC">
                    <h2>npm</h2>
                        <p>Using the npm command to install packages is very easy,
                            in order to install packages into a project a <span>package.json</span> file to handle the dependencies must be present.</p>
                    <h3>npm install &lt;package_name&gt;</h3>
                        <p>To install a package you need the exact package name, after it is as simple as writing npm install followed by that package name, 
                            this will install the package locally in your current standing directory.
                        </p>
                    <h3>npm install</h3>
                        <p>If one or more dependencies have been manually written in package.json simply using npm install
                            will install all dependencies defined within and it will make sure that it is the newest version.</p>
                    <h3>npm install &lt;package_name&gt; -g</h3>
                        <p>Like with previous commands this will also install a package, however where the other installed the packages locally, by using -g, 
                            this will install the package globally directly on your system for all your other projects to use.
                            <br>The -g can also be placed before the package name.</p>
                    <h3>npm i</h3>
                        <p>npm i, is simply used as a shortend version of npm install and will work in all cases where you would normally use npm install.</p>
                    <h3>npm run &lt;script_name&gt;</h3>
                        <p>If you have any declared scripts in your package.json file these can be run be using npm run with the name of the script,
                            scripts are can be used for quick access to commands and to make use of enviroment variables.
                    <h3>npm init</h3>
                        <p>It is possible to initialize npm directly in your project by using npm init this will take you through a guide of several items to fill in, like version, name etc.
                            <br>When the setup is complete, a package.json will be created with these settings filled into it, making manually creating and filling not needed.</p>
                    <h3>npm uninstall &lt;package_name&gt; (-g)</h3>
                        <p>The exact opposite of install, this command will uninstall any package that you have previously installed and remove it from your dependencies.
                            <br>It is also possible to add -g to uninstall a globally installed package.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="column">
                <div class="examples" id="lsC">
                    <h2>ls</h2>
                        <p>The ls command will show all the files, folders etc which exist on a given path, 
                            this means that you are capable of getting an overview over all items on a path after using cd, or just in general.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="dirC">
                    <h2>dir</h2>
                        <p>When in a Windows command prompt, ls is not a recoqnized as a command, this is because ls is a UNIX based command, here the command dir will accomplish the same task.</p>
                        <p>The exception here is that Windows Powershell will recoqnize ls as a command.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="nodemonC">
                    <h2>nodemon</h2>
                        <p>nodemon will make sure that your app is restarted everytime a change is detected, usefull for development, requires install via npm or to be run via npx.</p>
                    <h3>nodemon &lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>To run using nodemon use the path to the file you wish to execute and finish with the name of the file plus its extension.</p>
                    <h3>nodemon &lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>As with the node command, if the terminal is already correctly placed, the path can be omitted from the command.</p>
                    <h3>nodemon.cmd &lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>If using Windows Powershell the nodemon command differs slightly and needs the added .cmd to be run, the previous commands are based on UNIX.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="budoC">
                    <h2>budo</h2>
                        <p>budo is used for rapid web development and can enable live reload and is very usefull on work-in-progress sites.</p>
                    <h3>budo &lt;path&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>The budo command also needs to be directed through your directories to where your file to be run is located, followed by the filename and its extension.</p>
                    <h3>budo &lt;filename&gt;</h3>
                        <p>As before the path is unnecessary if you are located where you have direct access to the files you wish to run.</p>
                    <h3 style="color: rgb(255, 196, 0);">flags</h3>
                        <p>budo is often used with various extra features enabled, these are used via what is know as flags. 
                            <br>A flag is added after the filename and needs to be spaced, The flags can be used simultaneously with space between them,
                            here we will list the most common used ones.</p>
                    <h3>--live</h3>
                        <p>For live refresh and updates as work is being performed, budo will actually not run live-reload without this flag.</p>
                    <h3>--open</h3>
                        <p>Will automatically open your browser on the correct address when the project spins up, this address is your machines local ip and port 9966.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="npxC">
                    <h2>npx</h2>
                        <p>npx can be used to make a one-time execution of either a node_modules package or from a central cache, intalling packages needed for it to run.</p>
                    <h3>npx &lt;package_name&gt;</h3>
                        <p>In order to use npx, add npx infront of the execution of a different package that you wish to use, 
                            after which you simply follow the execution of said package.
                </div>
