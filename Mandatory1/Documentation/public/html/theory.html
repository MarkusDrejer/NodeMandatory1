                    <h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
                        <h3>var</h3>
                            <p>A variable type which is globally scoped when outside of a function 
                                and function scoped when inside a function.</p>
                            <p>var works with hoisting and can therfore be declared after usage.</p>
                            <p>A var can be redeclared which can result in unpredicted behavior if a redeclaration takes place
                                in a different scope.</p>

                        <h3>let</h3>
                            <p>let comes as an improvment over the var declaration and will solve the scoping problems.</p>
                            <p>is block scoped and only lives within a set of curly braces {}, 
                                let is allowed to be updated but not redeclared.</p>
                            <p>The same variable name can therefore only be used several times if they are within different scopes, 
                                it will otherwise result in a 'SyntaxError.'</p>
                            <p>Unlike var, let will not work properly with hoising, 
                                this is because where var is initialized as 'undefined',
                                let has no initialization, so trying to use it with hoising will result in a 'ReferenceError'.</p>

                        <h3>const</h3>
                            <p>A variable declaration with const will maintain a constant value, this means a const cannot be updated nor redeclared.</p>
                            <p>Like with let, const is also block scoped and can only be accessed within the block it was declared.</p>
                            <p>Because we are unable to update a const, it must always be initialized by the time of declaration.</p>
                            <p>Even though it is impossible to update the direct value of a const, the properties of the objects can be updated.</p>
                            <p>Hoisting of const work in the same way as let, as a const is also not initialized.</p>

                    <h2>Strings</h2>
                        <p>In Javascript we have several valid ways of writing Strings, these include:
                            <br>Double quotes = " "
                            <br>Single quotes = ' '
                            <br>Backticks = ` `</p>
                        <p>The reasoning for all these different ways is primarily 
                            so that a text which might include quoting can still be done in a proper fashion
                            and if you know you need to use double quotes as part of the text you can pick one of the other options for your String, 
                            as to not interfere with the declaration of the String itself.</p>
                        <p>Backticks also has a special feature as it supports direct insertion of variables into the String by writing ${&lt;variable&gt;},
                            this is not supported by double or single quotes.</P>
                        <p>String concatenation works in two ways in Javascript, either by applying the '+' operator or by using ',' between the two.
                            <br>Using '+' can lead to problems as it will completly disregard types and turn the entire thing into a String, 
                            whereas using ',' will keep the types, usually making it the better choice.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="jsonTH">
                    <h2>JSON</h2>
                        <p>JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and is used as a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. 
                            <br>It is often used to send data from servers to webpages.</p>
                        <p>The data kept in a JSON object is held in 'Key-Value pairs', meaning that every value will have a key which points to it, 
                            and to get that value you have to get it via its key, all the pairs are seperated by commas.</p>
                        <p>To annotate a JSON object you must start with curly braces: {}, otherwise it will not be valid JSON.
                            <br>Both the key and value must be wrapped as a String as this is the only format JSON will support</p>
                        <p>JSON is the main component in REST as it will focus only on returning data to the user nothing else, 
                            this makes JSON optimal since its easily readable by both humans and machines and can contain vast amounts of data.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="reqTH">
                    <h2>Requests</h2>
                        <p>As part of the build of a REST API we have a set of typically/standarly used HTTP methods, 
                            that cover the bases of the data we want to be able to get and manipulate.</p>
                        <p>GET: the GET request is the one which a user has direct access to as it happens via the URL-field in their browser, 
                            this request is used to get data out of the API and return it to the user in a JSON format.</p>
                        <p>POST: this is used to create new instances of data, like a new user by means of the request body, it is also usually used on login.</p>
                        <p>PUT: is used when updating an already existing item in the data, like updating the price of a product on a sales site.</p>
                        <p>DELETE: will be used when deleting an existing item.</p>
                        <p>All of these different request types can be used on a collection basis or singular basis, 
                            for instance you can GET all users or use an id to only GET one specfic user.</p>

                <div class="examples" id="loopTH">
                    <h2>Loops</h2>
                        <p>In Javascript there a couple of different loop types to work with, as with many languages While and For are the two most common ones.</p>
                        <p>The While loop is pretty uninteresting and works the same way here as in Java, with the While keyword followed by the condition.</p>
                        <p>For loops are a bit more interesting, here we deal with a more standard style as found in Java with a variable, condition and increment.
                            <br>But we can also make use of so called 'Enhanced' For loops which in a shorter manner can get either index or elements out of an array</p>
                        <p>for x in array: is an enhanced version of picking out the elements of the array and storing them in the variable x.</p>
                        <p>for x of array: will instead run through the index of the array and store it in x.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly it is possible to use a special foreach loop by writing: array.foreach(function), 
                            which will run through every element of the array and run the given function on each element.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="funcTH">
                    <h2>Functions</h2>
                        <p>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. 
                            <br>A function is a JavaScript procedure, a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. 
                            <br>To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.</p>
                        <h3>Standard Function</h3>
                            <p>The standard function in Javascript consists of the function keyword followed by the name, parameters and the actual code to be executed.</p>
                            <p>However this way of defining functions is a bit old and comes with some problems.
                                <br>The primary problem here is when using the 'this' keyword which is not closed to the function and can instead refer to higher scoped items, 
                                not just items present in the function itself, meaning you might get a wrong reference when using 'this'.</p>
                        <h3>Arrow Function</h3>
                            <p>A newer way of writing functions is by using what is called Arrow functions, 
                                this is basically a lambda expression of a function as it has no name and is as such anonomys.</p>
                            <p>Arrow functions start with the paranthesis with parameters followed by the '=>' arrow part and then the code to be executed.</p>
                            <p>Arrow functions are primarily easier to write and also fix the previous 'this' problem with the standard functions, 
                                because 'this' keyword is only valid within the function itself keeping it from creating problems.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="collTH">
                    <h2>Collections</h2>
                        <p>When talking about collections in Javascript we really only talk about one type, Arrays.
                            <br>This is because arrays in Javascript fulfills pretty much all the areas we need to cover in most cases.</p>
                        <p>Arrays in Javascript works much like in other languages, but has some extra interesting features:
                            <br>It supports push and pop like with a Stack from Java, with pop also being able to take a specfic index.
                            <br>It supports the spread(...) operator which will take all the values from the array and 'spreads' them into for instance another array for easy copying of elements.
                            <br>The arrays can also hold JSON objects.</p>
                        <p>And much more advance functions can be applied to arrays like search, filter etc. all of which makes arrays very versatile in Javascript.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="importTH">
                    <h2>Importing</h2>
                        <p>In order to use various libraries as part of our node projects, it is imperative that we import our libraries just like with most other languages.</p>
                        <p>As part of node we do not use the more common keyword 'import' which does seem like the most natural way to perform an import, 
                            instead we use the 'require' keyword.</p>
                        <p>require is actually a function which takes the library to be imported as a parameter.
                            <br>require is also available on a global scope and does not need to be required by itself.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="examples" id="depTH">
                    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
                        <p>All dependencies of a node project is handled either through the local package.json file or by globally installed packages.
                            <br>This means that all newly created project will have to re-install dependencies and packages (like Express) if they aren't already available on a global scope.</p>
                        <h3>package.json</h3>
                        <p>As said the local dependencies are managed via the projects package.json file, however this file does not come with newly made node projects,
                            instead it is important that you yourself create this file and make it a valid JSON file before starting to manage and trying to install dependencies.</p>
                        <p>This file is therefore one of the most important things to remember to add, or get by running the npm init command which will create the file after setup.</p>
