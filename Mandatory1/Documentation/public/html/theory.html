                    <h2>Variable Declaration</h2>
                        <h3 id="testing">var</h3>
                            <p>A variable type which is globally scoped when outside of a function 
                                and function scoped when inside a function.</p>
                            <p>var works with hoisting and can therfore be declared after usage.</p>
                            <p>A var can be redeclared which can result in unpredicted behavior if a redeclaration takes place
                                in a different scope.</p>

                        <h3>let</h3>
                            <p>let comes as an improvment over the var declaration and will solve the scoping problems.</p>
                            <p>is block scoped and only lives within a set of curly braces {}, 
                                let is allowed to be updated but not redeclared.</p>
                            <p>The same variable name can therefore only be used several times if they are within different scopes, 
                                it will otherwise result in a 'SyntaxError.'</p>
                            <p>Unlike var, let will not work properly with hoising, 
                                this is because where var is initialized as 'undefined',
                                let has no initialization, so trying to use it with hoising will result in a 'ReferenceError'.</p>

                        <h3>const</h3>
                            <p>A variable declaration with const will maintain a constant value, this means a const cannot be updated nor redeclared.</p>
                            <p>Like with let, const is also block scoped and can only be accessed within the block it was declared.</p>
                            <p>Because we are unable to update a const, it must always be initialized by the time of declaration.</p>
                            <p>Even though it is impossible to update the direct value of a const, the properties of the objects can be updated.</p>
                            <p>Hoisting of const work in the same way as let, as a const is also not initialized.</p>

                    <h2>Strings</h2>
                        <p>In Javascript we have several valid ways of writing Strings, these include:
                            <br>Double quotes = " "
                            <br>Single quotes = ' '
                            <br>Backticks = ` `</p>
                        <p>The reasoning for all these different ways is primarily 
                            so that a text which might include quoting can still be done in a proper fashion
                            and if you know you need to use double quotes as part of the text you can pick one of the other options for your String, 
                            as to not interfere with the declaration of the String itself.</p>
                        <p>Backticks also has a special feature as it supports direct insertion of variables into the String by writing ${&lt;variable&gt;},
                            this is not supported by double or single quotes, which both needs to use String concatenation.</P>
                        <p>String concatenation works in two ways in Javascript, either by applying the '+' operator or by using ',' between the two.
                            <br>Using '+' can lead to problems as it will completly disregard types and turn the entire thing into a String, 
                            whereas using ',' will keep the types, usually making it the better choice.</p>
